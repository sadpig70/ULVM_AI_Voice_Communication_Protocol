## 1. Concept Definition

This technology is an AI-based communication protocol that transmits and restores voice information at ultra-low bitrates using a combination of **[Language Code] + [Voice Embedding Seed] + [Text (STT)]** to maximize data transmission efficiency in real-time voice communication.

---

## 2. Core Components

- **Language Code**:  
  A fixed format code representing the spoken language, such as ISO 639-1 (e.g., 'ko', 'en', 'ja').  
  An optimization element for multilingual speech synthesis.

- **Voice Embedding Seed**:  
  A value that converts the speaker's unique tone, intonation, and emotion into high-dimensional embedding vectors.  
  A 128-512 dimensional real-value vector generated by high-speed neural network encoders (e.g., HuBERT, VQ-VAE, etc.).

- **Text (STT)**:  
  The original utterance text extracted as a result of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR, STT).  
  The core of communication information compression and data optimization.

## 3. Operating Protocol

1. **Transmission Stage**
    - Voice Input → [STT Conversion] → [Voice Embedding Extraction] → [Language Code Assignment]
    - Integrate the three items into packets or messages

2. **Transmission**
    - Send and receive minimized packets in the format of [Language Code] + [Voice Seed (Embedding)] + [Text] at ultra-low bitrates (hundreds of bps to several kbps)

3. **Reception and Restoration**
    - Receive the three elements as input
    - The receiving side's AI-TTS (Text-to-Speech) system completely regenerates voice signals based on the same language, speaker characteristics, and intrinsic text content

## 4. Features and Advantages

- **Extreme Data Minimization** (10-100+ times more efficient than conventional voice transmission)
- **Complete Reproduction of Speaker Characteristics and Language Information**
- **Real-time Communication and Optimization for Satellite/Disaster Networks/Low Bandwidth Environments**
- **Modular Scalability** (easy multilingual support, various speakers, emotion/intonation expression, etc.)

## 5. Applicable Fields

- Satellite communication, vehicle/IoT voice networks
- Emergency rescue, military/disaster communication, mobile messengers
- Next-generation AI content/device communication low-level protocols
